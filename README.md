# Xamarin CRM

![](https://github.com/xamarin/demo-xamarincrm-internal/blob/master/src/MobileApp/markdown-graphics/XamarinCRM_screenshots.png)

This is a very basic readme for now.

The app consists of three parts:
  1. A Xamarin.Forms mobile app for iOS and Android.
  2. A javascript-backed Azure Mobile Service (Azure REST API) for customer and order data.
  2. A .NET Web API-backed Entity Framework based Azure Mobile Service for catalog data.

This readme will be expanded soon.
