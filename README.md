# Xamarin CRM
This is a very basic readme for now.

The app consists of three parts:
  1. A Xamarin.Forms mobile app for iOS and Androd.
  2. A javascript-backed Azure Mobile Service (Azure REST API) for customer and order data.
  2. A .NET Web API-backed Entity Framework based Azure MObile Service for catalog data.
